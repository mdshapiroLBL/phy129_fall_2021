Note that the value of $m$ is the same for all columns in a given subtable and also note that $m_1 + m_2$ always equals this value of $m$ for each row. This is a reflection of the fact that the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are all zero unless $m_1+m_2=m$ . The other entries give numbers which are related to the values of the coefficients.

Our notation is to write the coefficent as $C_{m1 m_2}^{J m_j}$.
