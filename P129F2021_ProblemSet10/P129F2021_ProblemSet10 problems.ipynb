    "On problem set 9, you looked at the process $pp\\rightarrow \\mu^+\\mu^- X$.  This process occurs via the electomagnetic interaction. The cross section (calculated to lowest order in perturbationtheory) is  proportional to $\\alpha^2$ (a factor of $e^2$ in the matrix element leads to a factor of  $e^4$ in the cross section).\n",

    "Consider instead the process $pp\\rightarrow jjX$ where $j$ is a jet coming from  the hadronization of a parton (a quark, an antiquark or a gluon).  This process occurs through the strong interaction and the lowest order term for the cross section is therefore proportional to $\\alpha_S^2$. Draw all the Feynman diagrams that contribute to this lowest order calculation.  (You are not required to label the vertex or propagator factors but you should put arrows on the lines corresponding to incoming or outgoing fermions.\n",

We can understand much about charmonium using insight gained from our understanding of positronium.  The degeneracy of the $n=1$ state of positronium is split due to spin-spin interactions to  Spin-0  para-positronium and Spin-1 otho-positronium.  The decay rates for these two states are quite different since para-positronium can decay to two photons while ortho-positronium cannot and therefore decays to three photons (due to charge conjugation invariance).
