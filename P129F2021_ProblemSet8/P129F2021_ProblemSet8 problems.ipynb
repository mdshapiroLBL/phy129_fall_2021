    "The goal of this problem is to make you more comfortable with the language of Feynman diagrams.  Although we won'd calculate the matrix elements explictly, we can learn a lot about the cross section by examing these diagrams.  In each case below, draw the relevant Feynman diagrams.  Label each incoming and outgoing leg with the particle species and momentum (call incoming particle momenta $p_1$ and $p_2$ and outgoing particle momenta $p_3$ and $p_4$. Using the rules shown on page 124 of Thomson or on page 17 of the notes for Lecture 15, mark each external line, internal propagator and vertex with the appropriate factor.  make sure your external lines have arrows indicating  whether the line represents a particle or an antiparticle. Thomson Figure 5.7 is an example of what your drawings should look like."
