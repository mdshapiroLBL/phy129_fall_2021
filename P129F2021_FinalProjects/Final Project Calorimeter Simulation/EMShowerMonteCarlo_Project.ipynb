    "In order to understand how their detectors respond, particle physicists use complex simulations.  These simulations take as their input Monte Carlo generated events, propagate the particles in these events through a model of the detector and simulate the response.  The output of the simulation is written in the same format as the real data and is used to understand the experiment's acceptance and resolution. Proper modeling of the detector response requires detailed understanding of the physics of particle interactions with matter.  Today, most experiments use a simulation toolkit, called Geant4, to model this physics. In this problem, you will write your own Monte Carlo simulation of electromagnetic showers and use it to describe shower development in the CMS electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL).

The distribution of energy loss per unit distance is a Landau distribution, with a mean that depends on the particle's velocity.

If a charged particle ($e^+$ or $e^-$) loses enough energy via ionization to stop in the crystal, then it will just be absorbed in the material.

    "Now that you have a working Monte Carlo, we want to know what the energy resolution of the detector is. Recall that when a particle of fixed energy $E_0$ strikes the calorimeter, we are not guaranteed to measure $E_0$. Instead, there are many different energy values we may measure. The probability of the measured value will be a normal distribution in energy centered at $E_0$. The standard deviation of this normal distribution defines the energy resolution of the detector. When physicists build a detector, they often calibrate its response by putting into a \"test beam\" where particles of known energy are shot into the detector and the response is measured. Let's calibrate our calorimeter using this technique.  Modify your Monte Carlo algorithm to keep track of the total energy deposited in the crystal from each of the thousand 1-GeV events. The total energy in the crystal is the integral of charged the particle density along the entire crystal length. We will ignore the photons for the remainder of the project."

    "At this point, you have created a simulation that returns the charged particle density in the calorimeter as a function of length, and you can run the simulation at different energies. Since the integral of this function is our proxy for the total energy, we can take the function itself to be approximately equal to $dE/dx$. Refer to equation 33.36 in the PDG Booklet. In case there are differences in the equation numbers depending on the booklet version, the equation is: $$\\frac{dE}{dt} = E_0 b \\frac{(bt)^{a-1}e^{-bt}}{\\Gamma(a)} $$\n",
    "where $t$ is the dimensionless length scale $x/X0$, and $a, b$ are constants to which the data are fit. Since you have been storing the charged particle number, rather than the energy, you will need to normalize everything with respect to the $1 GeV$ simulation, i.e. divide the charged particle density by the total number of charged particles deposited at 1 GeV. This effectively gives you the conversion constant from number of particles to energy in GeV. Using your data from Part 2, what are the values of $a$ and $b$ for this crystal at $E_0 = 1, 3, 5,$ and $10$ GeV? In your write-up, list these in a table. You may compute the uncertainty on these parameters, but you are not required to do so. Note that you may need to `import scipy` to fit your data to this function."
