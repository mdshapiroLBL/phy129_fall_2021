Your resonances R<sup>0</sup><sub>2</sub> and R<sup>0</sup><sub>3</sub> are both composed of the same particle types, K<sup>+</sup>K<sup>-</sup>, and hence have the same distributions. It is useful to impose an ordering which distinguishes the resonances. We can call the resonances R<sup>0</sup><sub>Low</sub> and R<sup>0</sup><sub>High</sub>. In each event R<sup>0</sup><sub>Low</sub> is the resonance with the lower mass and the other corresponds to the higher mass combination of kaons.

    "Here are some ideas of how you could explore the data further, but you are welcome to take your project in a different direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **CP Asymmetries in the with and without resonances**\n",
    "For the case of charmless $B^\\pm$ decays, compare the asymmetry you observe for events where two of the kaons are the decay products if a $\\phi$ to the \"non-responant\" case where the three kaons are not produced through an intermediate resonance \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Systematic Uncertainties**\n",
    "In this analysis you considered the statistical uncertainty on the result. This occurs as a result of having only a limited number of events. In addition there are [systematic uncertainties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_error#Systematic_versus_random_error), these arise from biases in your measurement. One source of uncertainty is a possible asymmetry in the efficiency for reconstructing positively and negatively charged tracks. In this case, the LHCb detector could be more efficient for detecting either the $B^{+}$  or the $B^{-}$ final state. This difference arises because the positive and negative kaons will be bent by the magnet indifferent directions in the detector. If the efficiency of the detector is higher in one region than another this will to a charge asymmetry in the detection efficiency. For this reason the magnetic field of the LHCb detector is regularly reversed. You used data in this analysis in which the magnetic field was both up and down and hence the effect will (partially) cancel. By comparing results for the two magnet polarities separately you can check the size of this effect. When loading the data above both polarities were combined, you can instead load them independently to measure the difference between the two datasets. estimate the number of background events under the mass peak.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Fitting distributions** The next level of sophistication in the analysis requires fitting the distributions of events that are observed in the B mass distribution in order to estimate the yield of signal events and background events. You can see how this is done in the LHCb paper on the analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Measuring the CP Asymmetry for $B\\rightarrow D^{0}K$ event** The published LHCb analysis removes events where two of the kaons are decay produces of a $D^0$.  You could study the asymmetry separately for such events.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Measurement of the lifetime of the $B^0$ meson** The data above include the flight length for each event.  You can therefore measure the $B^0$ lifetime.  Note:  To remove background, the data pre-selection requred a minimum value for the flight length.  You can determine that value from the data.\n",
